# Scotland's Places - OS Name Books Scraper

This project contains a Python script that scrapes place name data from the Ordnance Survey Name Books on the Scotland's Places website.

## Description

The script uses the `httpx` library to send HTTP requests and the `selectolax` library to parse the HTML responses. 
It navigates to the page for each volume of the Ordnance Survey Name Books, extracts the place name data from the page, and stores the data in a structured format.
